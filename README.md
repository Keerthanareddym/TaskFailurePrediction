# 🚀 Task Failure Prediction in Cloud Data Centres using Hybrid Learning Paradigms
This project is about “Task failure prediction in cloud data centers using Hybrid Learning Paradigms" where we can predict the failures of task/job with predictions using deep learning models.


## 📌 Project Overview

In large-scale cloud data centres, millions of tasks run every day, and task failures due to hardware issues, software bugs, or resource conflicts can cause serious service disruptions. This project leverages **Hybrid Deep Learning** (CNN + BiLSTM) models to **predict task failures before they occur**, improving reliability, efficiency, and fault tolerance in cloud environments.


## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.7
- TensorFlow & Keras
- Scikit-learn
- Flask (for Web Interface)
- SQLite (for database)
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🏗️ Project Structure
Ah, I see the problem! That is a very common formatting issue. Thank you for sharing the screenshot.

The project structure looks like one long line because GitHub isn't rendering the line breaks correctly. To fix this, you need to tell Markdown to treat it as a pre-formatted code block.

Here is the corrected code. Notice the triple backticks (```) at the beginning and end.

Solution: Use a Code Block
Go back and edit your README.md file on GitHub.
Delete the entire "Project Structure" section that looks broken.
Copy and paste the code below to replace it.
✅ Copy this corrected block:
